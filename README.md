## 💭 Back story

Recently I've migrated my entire Google photos library to Immich, I was able to successfully migrate all my assets along with its albums to immich. But there were few things like people match that was lacking. I loved Immich UI on the whole but for organizing content I felt its quite restricted and I had to do a lot of things in bulk instead of opening each asset and doing it. Hence I built this tool (continuing to itereate) to make my life and any other Immich user's life easier.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐬 Using Docker

#### Power-tools is designed to be used alongside Immich, and there are two ways you can run it.
#### Method 1 - Docker Compose ( Recommended )

Add the following into your docker compose as a new service along side other immich services. Make sure you've `power-tools` in same network as immich.

See the sample [docker-compose-all-immich.yml](./docker-compose-all-immich.yml) file for reference.

```yaml
services:
  # Other services...
  power-tools:
    container_name: immich_power_tools
    image: ghcr.io/immich-power-tools/immich-power-tools:latest
    volumes:
      - immich-power-tools-data:/app/data
    ports:
      - "8001:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env

volumes:
  immich-power-tools-data:
```

Add the Immich API Key and immich url's to the env file (which you already have for the immich).
You also need to add `DB_PORT` (Default 5432) and `DB_HOST`, which has to be set to the name of the immich database
container (Default `immich_postgres`).

```bash
IMMICH_API_KEY= # your_immich_api_key
IMMICH_URL = "http://local-ip-of-immich:port" # Your immich instace ip address and port
EXTERNAL_IMMICH_URL = "https://external-address" # External address of immich

DB_PORT = "5432"
DB_HOST = "immich_postgres"

# Optional - AI Configuration for Smart Search (Find)
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here # API key for your OpenAI-compatible provider
AI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1" # e.g. https://api.openai.com/v1 (OpenAI), https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 (Groq), http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1 (Ollama)
AI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini" # e.g. gpt-4o-mini, llama-3.1-8b-instant, llama3.1
```
Refer here for obtaining Immich API Key: https://immich.app/docs/features/command-line-interface#obtain-the-api-key

> [!NOTE] When creating the API key, make sure you select all the permissions for the API key.  

### Optional: Missing Originals Tool

The Missing Originals tool scans Immich asset records and checks whether each `originalPath` still exists on disk. To use it, mount your Immich upload location into the Power Tools container as read-only and enable the feature explicitly.

```yaml
services:
  power-tools:
    volumes:
      - immich-power-tools-data:/app/data
      - ${UPLOAD_LOCATION}:/mnt/immich-upload:ro
```

```env
MISSING_ORIGINALS_ENABLED=true
```

The tool only reads the mounted upload path. It automatically scans common internal Immich upload prefixes like `/data` and `/usr/src/app/upload`, and it ignores external libraries. It does not alter Immich Postgres directly. Confirmed missing asset records are moved to Immich Trash through the Immich API.

The scan follows the rest of Power Tools' ownership model: it checks only the authenticated Immich user's active, non-external assets. Admin users and admin API keys are still scoped to their own uploaded assets.

Optional configuration:

```env
# Required to show and use the tool.
MISSING_ORIGINALS_ENABLED=true

# Optional. Use when Immich stores originals under a custom internal container prefix.
# Common values are /data or /usr/src/app/upload.
MISSING_ORIGINALS_DB_PREFIX=/data

# Optional. Use when the upload location is mounted somewhere other than /mnt/immich-upload.
MISSING_ORIGINALS_SCAN_ROOT=/mnt/immich-upload

# Optional. Stops trash actions when the missing count is above this percent of eligible assets.
MISSING_ORIGINALS_MAX_MISSING_PERCENT=20

# Optional. Number of concurrent file existence checks during a scan.
MISSING_ORIGINALS_CONCURRENCY=64
```

#### Method 2 - Portainer

If you're using portainer, run the docker using `docker run` and add the power tools to the same network as immich.

```bash
# Run the power tools from docker 
docker run -d --name immich_power_tools -p 8001:3000 -v immich-power-tools-data:/app/data --env-file .env ghcr.io/immich-power-tools/immich-power-tools:latest

# Add Power tools to the same network as immich
docker network connect immich_default immich_power_tools
```


### 🚀 For local development

> [!NOTE]  
> Please use `bun` to run the project. If you don't have `bun` installed, checkout [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) for installation.


Copy paste the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
  IMMICH_URL="" # Immich URL
  IMMICH_API_KEY="" # Immich API Key
  DB_USERNAME="" # Postgress Database Username
  DB_PASSWORD = "" # Postgres Database Password
  DB_HOST = "" # Postgres Host (IP address or hostname of the database)
  DB_PORT = "" # Postgres Port number (Default: 5432)
  DB_DATABASE_NAME="" # Name of the database 
  
  # Optional - AI Configuration for Smart Search (Find)
  AI_API_KEY="" # API key for your OpenAI-compatible provider
  AI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1" # Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API
  AI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini" # Model used for parsing search queries in "Find"
```
> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure you have postgres port exposed on you machine.

Refer here for obtaining Immich API Key: https://immich.app/docs/features/command-line-interface#obtain-the-api-key

Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## External Services
These services are completely optional and you can use the tool without them. Just that they are used for some of the features. But we dont send any personal data to these services.

- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) for heatmap
Google Maps Javascript API Key is used to render the maps layer for heatmap. When rendering the heatmap, we only send the location data to Google Maps and not any other data.

  > Code where heatmap data is plotted: [src/pages/assets/geo-heatmap.tsx:32](./src/pages/assets/geo-heatmap.tsx#L32-L35)

- OpenAI-compatible AI provider for smart query parsing in Find
Any OpenAI-compatible API can be used for parsing your search query in the "Find" page. You can use standard providers like **OpenAI** and **Groq**, or run local models using **Ollama** or **LM Studio**. We do not send any personal library data to the AI provider; only your search text is sent for parsing. The actual asset querying uses [Immich's Smart Search API](https://immich.app/docs/api/search-smart).

  > Code where AI parsing is used: [src/helpers/ai.helper.ts](./src/helpers/ai.helper.ts)

  **Examples:**
  - **OpenAI:** `AI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`, `AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini`
  - **Groq:** `AI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, `AI_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant`
  - **Ollama (local):** `AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1` (or `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` if running Power Tools in Docker), `AI_MODEL=llama3.1`
